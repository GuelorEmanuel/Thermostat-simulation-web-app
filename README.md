#Assignment #2: The Heat Is on:Node.js Internet Of Things
Author: Guelor Emanuel
Brief Info:
--------------------
- This is a simulation of an "internet of things" smart home. 

  ``The idea is to enable the ability to be able to control the thermostat from a browser then the thermostat controls furnace via internet.
  ```
# Developed on: Windows 8.1
Compiling/Running instructions:
0. Start in the `root` dir.


1. Run thermostatServer first, using command:

  ```node thermostatServer.js
  ```
2. Run furnaceClient second, using command:

  ```node furnaceClient.js
  ```
3.  visit https://localhost:3000

  - If this fails, either the api to http://openweathermap.org has changed or something really bad happened.
